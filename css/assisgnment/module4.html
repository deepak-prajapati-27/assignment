    <h2>Q-1: What are the benefits of using CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      Faster Page Speed More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you
      to use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to all
      occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better User Experience CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it
      also allows for user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in
      logical places and well organized, user experience improves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quicker Development Time With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules
      and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. One cascading style
      sheet can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance,
      you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and
      feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of that
      same type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Easy Formatting Changes If you need to change the format of a specific set
      of pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every
      individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see
      changes applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compatibility Across Devices Responsive web design matters. In today’s day
      and age, web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all
      devices. Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines
      with HTML to make responsive design possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Q-2: What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among web browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program
      across multiple browsers.
    </p>
    <p>There exists a scarcity of security.</p>
    <p>
      After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they
      appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The programming language world is complicated for non-developers and
      beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite
      confusing. Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some
      are not). CSS works differently on different browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic. There might be cross-browser
      issues while using CSS. There are multiple levels which creates confusion
      for non-developers and beginners.
    </p>

    <h2>What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h2>
    <p>
      CSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding
      font properties such as typeface and emphasis color of text, backgrounds,
      and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other
      media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was
      released in 1999 and presentation-style properties were added in it that
      allows you to build a presentation from documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its
      specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a
      whole lot easier to handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS3 came up with some key web design considerations like rounded borders
      that help in rounding up the borders without any hassle. This turned out
      to be a huge plus point for developers who were struggling with initial
      versions of CSS borders.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS3 has the capability to split text sections into multiple columns so
      that it can be read like a newspaper. In CSS2, the developers had
      difficulty because the standard was not equipped with automatically
      breaking the text so that it fits within a box.

    <!-- <h2>Name a few CSS style components</h2>
    <p></p> -->
    <h2>What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h2>
    <p>
      The opacity in CSS is the property of an element that describes the
      transparency of the element. It is the opposite of transparency &
      represents the degree to which the content will be hidden behind an
      element.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can apply the opacity with different styling properties to the
      elements.
    </p>
    <h3>A few of them are discussed below:</h3>

    <p>
      Image Opacity: The opacity property is used in the image to describe the
      transparency of the image. The value of opacity lies between 0.0 to 1.0
      where a low value represents high transparency and a high value represents
      low transparency. The percentage of opacity is calculated as Opacity% =
      Opacity * 100.
    </p>

    <h2>How can the background color of an element be changed?</h2>
    <p>
      You can change the background color of an HTML element using the
      background-color CSS property and giving it a value of a color.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <h2>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</h2>
    <p>
      we can controll iamge repeatatio by using background-repeat:no-repeat;
      property.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <h2>What is the use of the background-position property?</h2>
    <p>
      Background-position propert is used to apply position to a
      background-image.
    </p>

    <!-- <hr /> -->
    <h2>Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h2>
    <p>
      background-attachment: fixed; <br />
      this property is used to make the image scroll in the background.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <!--  -->
    <h2>Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h2>
    <p>
      The reasons for this are as follows: - It increases the legibility of the
      style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS. If it
      is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
    </p>

    <h2>How to center block elements using CSS1?</h2>
    <p>
      By Using Margin property we can align an element center.

    <h2>How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h2>
    <p>
      If you've followed this series from the beginning , we discussed about the
      HTML Specification which is sort of a rule book that tells browser vendors
      how to implement HTML Elements and Tags. The CSS Specification is no
      different but with a different approach with the advent of CSS3.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Specification defines how CSS properties should be implemented by
      browser vendors along with detailed algorithms, code samples and tabular
      information.
    </p>

    <h3>The Specification also include:</h3>

    <p>
      The syntax and data types of the language Detailed explanation on CSS
      Selectors How you can assign values to properties The Cascade (the "C" in
      CSS) How inheritance works

    <h2>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h2>
    <p>
      CSS is used for styling the look and formatting of a document written in
      HTML. There are three ways to add CSS in HTML <br />
      <br />

      Inline CSS: Styles added directly to the HTML element. <br />
      Internal CSS: Styles defined at the head section of the document. <br />
      External CSS: Styles defined in a separate file.
    </p>

    <h2>What is embedded style sheets?</h2>
    <p>
      Embedded style sheets refer to when you embed style sheet information into
      an HTML document using the &lt;style&gt; element. You do this by embedding
      the style sheet information within &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt;tags in the
      head of your document.
    </p>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>
      The CSS syntax for embedded style sheets is exactly the same as other CSS
      code. For example, to use the following code, simply place it between the
      &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; tags of your HTML document:

    <h2>What are the external style sheets?</h2>
    <p>
      An external style sheet is a separate file linked to an HTML web page. It
      comes with a .css filename extension. All the styles that need to be used
      on a website can be declared in the external style sheet. External style
      sheets are an important tool from the webmaster’s perspective.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <!--  -->
    <h2>
      What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?
    </h2>

    <h3>The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are:</h3>
    <p>
      - In order to import style information for each document, an extra
      download is needed. <br />
      - Until the external style sheet is loaded, it may not be possible to
      render the document. <br />
      - For small number of style definitions, it is not viable.

    <h2>What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h2>
    <h3>
      CSS selectors are used to select the content you want to style. Selectors
      are the part of CSS rule set. CSS selectors select HTML elements according
      to its id, class, type, attribute etc.
    </h3>
    <h4>There are several different types of selectors in CSS.</h4>

    <p>
      Element Selector <br />
      CSS Id Selector <br />
      CSS Class Selector <br />
      CSS Universal Selector CSS Group Selector

    <h2>What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most important features of style sheets is that they specify
      how a document is to be presented on different media: on the screen, on
      paper, with a speech synthesizer, with a braille device, etc. Certain CSS
      properties are only designed for certain media (e.g., the
      'page-break-before' property only applies to paged media). On occasion,
      however, style sheets for different media types may share a property, but
      require different values for that property. For example, the 'font-size'
      property is useful both for screen and print media. The two media types
      are different enough to require different values for the common property;
      a document will typically need a larger font on a computer screen than on
      paper. Therefore, it is necessary to express that a style sheet, or a
      section of a style sheet, applies to certain media types.

    <h2>What is the rule set?</h2>
    <p>
      A CSS ruleset is various affirmations to various pieces or elements of the
      document. The objective is to apply a bunch of properties for certain
      distinct qualities to a solitary, or a particular arrangement of
      components in the connected HTML page.
