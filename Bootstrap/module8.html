    <h2>What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required
      when using our default grid system.
      <br />Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the
      content within them.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the default Bootstrap text settings?</h2>
    <p>Default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5.</p>
    <h2>What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h2>
    <p>
      Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to
      layout and align content.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Enhanced Grid System</strong> The grid system is retained in
      Bootstrap 5. However, an extra grid tier xxl has been introduced to
      minimize the effort in making the pages responsive on higher resolution
      displays. Columns don't have a default relative position in Bootstrap 5.
      Classes have been added to address vertical spacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enhanced Form Elements</strong> The form elements in Bootstrap 4
      have defaulted to the browser-provided view. However, in Bootstrap 5, the
      form elements have a custom design that enables them to have a consistent
      look and feel in all browsers. The new form controls are based on
      completely semantic, standard form controls. This helps developers to
      avoid adding extra markups for form controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Utilities API</strong> Unlike Bootstrap 4, Bootstrap 5 enables the
      developers to modify and create their own utilities. You can simply use
      sass to create your own utilities. You can use the state option to
      generate dummy class variations like hover and focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> Support for IE</strong>
      Bootstrap 5 no longer supports Internet Explorer 10 and 11 like its
      predecessor, Bootstrap 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> Extended Colors</strong>
      Bootstrap 4 had limited color options. But Bootstrap 5 has included many
      new color options to its color palette, enabling you to choose from the
      various shades available. You can find some of the color shades below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bootstrap Icons</strong>
      Bootstrap 4 didn't have an SVG icon library. You had to use other
      third-Party libraries like Font Awesome to use icons in your applications.
      But Bootstrap 5 has taken care of this issue by introducing its own SVG
      library with 1000+ icons.

    <h2>
      What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bootstrap allows you to group a series of buttons together (on a single
      line) in a button group
    </p>
    <div class="w-100">
      <img src="images/btn-group.png" alt="" />
    </div>

    <h2>How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?</h2>
    <p>
      Add an anchor tag with the class of .thumbnail around an image. <br />This
      adds four pixels of padding and a gray border. <br />On hover, an animated
      glow outlines the image.
    </p>
    <h2>In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h2>
    <p>
      In Bootstrap 4, flex box is used to control the layout and alignment
      specification of Bootstrap 4 components. This box makes it easier to
      design flexible responsive layout structures without using float or
      positioning attributes.

    <h2>How can one create an alert in Bootstrap?</h2>
    <img src="images/alert-input.png" alt="" />
    <img src="images/alert-output.png" alt="" />
    <h2>What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one?</h2>
    <p>
      A basic Bootstrap card consists of a . card class with the . card-body
      class, allowing you to add text, images, links, and other Bootstrap
      elements within a rounded border.
    </p>
    <img src="images/card.png" alt="" />
