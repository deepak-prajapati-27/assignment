        The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to
        represent a value that is the lowest available. This means that no other
        number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made

      <h2>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h2>

      <h2>Session State</h2>
      <p>
        contains information that is pertaining to a specific session (by a
        particular client/browser/machine) with the server. It's a way to track
        what the user is doing on the site.. across multiple pages...amid the
        statelessness of the Web. e.g. the contents of a particular user's
        shopping cart is session data. Cookies can be used for session state.
      </p>

      <h2>View State</h2>
      <p>
        on the other hand is information specific to particular web page. It is
        stored in a hidden field so that it isn't visible to the user. It is
        used to maintain the user's illusion that the page remembers what he did
        on it the last time - dont give him a clean page every time he posts
        back.

      <h2>What is the use of Void (0)?</h2>
      <p>
        The void operator is often used merely to obtain the undefined primitive
        value, usually using “void(0)” (which is equivalent to “void 0”). In
        these cases, the global variable undefined can be used instead (assuming
        it has not been assigned to a non-default value).

      <h2>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>
        Inner HTML is slow because when we use the inner HTML property in the
        code it allows us to change using the JavaScript language. It is very
        slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to
        parse the content again so that’s why it takes time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved When we have
        used the event handlers then the event handlers are not automatically
        attached to the new elements created by innerHTML. To change that, we
        have to track the. event handlers and manually attach them to a new
        element. It means that first, we have to fetch the element property
        through innerHTML, and then we have to attach them to a new element
